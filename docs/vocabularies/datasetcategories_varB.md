## Dataset categories
### Variant B: strict reference to  EC Delegated Regulations – each category is clearly assigned to one  EC Delegated Regulation

Usage note: This controlled vocabulary enables a dataset category description in two hierarchy levels:
•	“Dataset type category”: mandatory, only one selection possible 
•	“Dataset detailed description”: optional, multiple-selections possible
This means the data provider would select one generic option of a “Dataset type category” first, and then optionally concretise this with one or more options of “Dataset detailed description”.
